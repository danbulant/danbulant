### Hello there!

This is my github page for nearly all my projects. If you want to see my work, I recommend looking at these repositories:

* [Aztec](https://github.com/iceproductions/discord-bot) - Universal discord bot with advanced configuration and custom functions.
* [IP website](https://github.com/iceproductions/website) - Website for Ice Productions. For results, see [aztec.bot](https://iceproductions.dev).
* [Commando](https://github.com/iceproductions/Commando) - Commando is very useful framework, so we decided to alter it and make it even better.
* [Ice Browser](https://github.com/iceproductions/browser) - Browser based on wexond and dot aiming at security, privacy and looks.
* [Sketchware](https://github.com/danbulant/sketchware-cz) - Czech translation for Sketchware
* [Deno FCGI](https://github.com/danbulant/dejs-fcgi) - Deno FastCGI server which works like PHP - write code using ejs, connect Deno FCGI to your webserver and you're ready to go.
* [Osu!Visualizer](https://github.com/danbulant/osuVisualizer) - I wanted to listen to my osu beatmaps on background so I made this.
