### Hello there!

This is my github page for nearly all my projects. If you want to see my work, I recommend looking at these repositories:

* [Heaventaker](https://github.com/danbulant/heaventaker) - Open-source visual novel ([web](https://heaventaker.danbulant.eu/)) game, also available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.danbulant.heaventaker&utm_source=github_profile). On [itch.io](https://danbulant.itch.io/heaventaker).
* [Mangades](https://github.com/danbulant/Mangades) - Mangadex simple website client, used for simple viewing (much lighter site than Mangadex itself) and downloading (in e-book reader compatible formats, supported EPUB and CBZ).
* [Gists](https://github.com/danbulant/gists) - Simple site for my markdown texts. Hosted on [text.danbulant.eu](https://text.danbulant.eu).
* [Deno installation](https://github.com/danbulant/deno_install) - Czech information about how to install Deno.
* [Commando](https://github.com/iceproductions/Commando) - A framework for discord.js bots with advanced command and argument handling.
* [Deno FCGI](https://github.com/danbulant/dejs-fcgi) - Deno FastCGI server which works like PHP - write code using ejs, connect Deno FCGI to your webserver and you're ready to go.
* [Osu!Visualizer](https://github.com/danbulant/osuVisualizer) - I wanted to listen to my osu beatmaps on background so I made this.
